<h3>This is a personal project made to gauge my grasp on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</h3>
<p>This is still incomplete and needs much more work. I am yet to add any functionalkity to the site.</p>

<p>I tried to make the website responsive. It is not yet perfect, but I a content with myself for now and will thrive to move as close to perfection as possible.</p>

# Referece

<h3>I was browsing Pinterest and came across <a href="https://pin.it/6Kp8piD" style="text-decoration:none; color:#00aaff">this post</a> which I used as an inpiration and tried to imitate it.</h3>
<p>I first made <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/sdPFk4JyiONBFEdC8lCcEw/Personal-Blog?type=design&node-id=6%3A5&mode=design&t=rW0F77BtctlTTHZV-1" style="text-decoration:none; color:#00aaff">the design</a> with figma. I tried to imitate the design without any reference and then refined it with reference to the one from Pinterest.</p>

<p>Finally, after I was done with the design, I jumped to VS code to actually develop the website. But, what dissapointed me the most is that I was unable to write the code with efficiency that I imageined. For example, the HTML nesting and semantic tags was not satisfactory, the css styles were not really modular, although I have tried to reduce redundancy as much as I could, i was still not satisfied with it.</p>

<h2>In the end, I would like to just mention that, even though I am not satisfied with my progress till now, I am willing to learn more and more, build more projects, and I will be sure to update this projcet with each new thing I learn and this project will be that one project I will use to measure my progress throughout my journey.</h2>
